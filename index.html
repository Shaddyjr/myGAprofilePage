		<p id="edu" class="turnOn">I recieved my BS in Biology from Georgetown University. Years later, I recieved my master's in Biolgy from New York Univerity, with a focus on bioinformatics. Currently, I'm a month from recieving certification in <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science">Data Science Specialization</a> from John Hopkin's online Coursera course.</p>

			<h2><a href="http://www.allstarcode.org/">All Star Code</a></h2>
			<p>I'm working full-time as the Curriculum Manager at All Star Code (ASC), where I've already successfully lead the 2016 Summer Intensive. ASC is a non-profit strives to foster entrepreneurship and coding skill in black male youths in order to offset the underrepresentation of men of color in the tech industry. Though challenging, the work is incredibly rewarding. Teaching the students at ASC has greatly improved my own technical skill and I've been humbled by my time at ASC, where celebrating failure is a catalyst for learning.</p>
			<h2><a href="http://scholarstem.com/">ScholarStem</a></h2>
			<p>I'm also working part-time as the Curriculum Developer at ScholarStem (SS), where I've been working for a year. SS is a for-profit organization looking to fill the education need for coding in schools for grades 3-8 (both with instructors and as professional development for current teachers). ScholarStem uses a kid-freindly curriculum with interactive lessons about Scratch to introduction coding, while slowly ramping up to Javascript. For the older grades, Javascript skills are more fully realized and the curriculum culminates in a full on Javascript library capstone project.</p>
			<p>Having taught children before, working with SS was my first experience teaching coding to middle-schoolers. Its was an enlightening and enjoyable experience. I wish I could of had these classes when I was their age!</p>

		<p id="fun">Besides enjoying gaming and puzzles on my free time, I greatly enjoy cooking, gardening, beekeeping, and composting. My wife and I are highly interested in the natural world and can often be found in a park or on a farm. I also find myself tackling more and more coding projects for work, my friends, and my own interests.</p>

		<article id="future">
			<p>After attending the Android Development Immersive at General Assembly, I plan on using what I learn to create a 1-week addition to the 2017 Summer Intensive curriculum at All Star Code; our students craved mobile apps this year, but despite my best efforts, I lacked the skills to accommodate them.</p>
			<p>Additionally, I plan to use what I learn to benefit my community. I've already promised to help the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/nyc-beekeeping/?https=off">New York City beekeepers</a> in making a user-friendly app to help with record-keeping and data collection.</p>
			<p>Of course I will also <strong>finally</strong> be able to create the many apps I've had in mind for years for my own personal use.</p>
